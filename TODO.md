### From Microsoft Copilot:

"Building a web app that utilizes **FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)** is a great initiative. FHIR is designed to facilitate interoperability in healthcare systems, making it easier to exchange health-related data. Since you're planning to implement your web app using **React**, I'll guide you through the steps to get started:

1. **~~Start from the Vite Template**:~~
   - ~~Begin by creating your React app using the **Vite template**. Vite is a fast build tool for modern web development.~~
   - ~~You can follow the tutorial provided by **bonFHIR** to create a simple FHIR web app using the Vite template¹.~~
   - ~~The tutorial covers key concepts and walks you through the entire process, from setup to building a fully functional web app with tables and inputs.~~

2. **~~Setup a Local FHIR Server**:~~
   - ~~For development purposes, you'll need a local FHIR server. **Medplum** is a good choice as a FHIR backend for development.~~
   - ~~Set up Medplum locally to simulate FHIR interactions within your app.~~

3. **Display FHIR Data**:
   - Retrieve FHIR resources (such as patient records, observations, or medications) from your local server.
   - Display the formatted properties of these resources in your React app.

4. **Create a Table with Pagination**:
   - Once you have FHIR data, create a paginated table to display the resources.
   - Implement pagination so that users can navigate through the data efficiently.

Remember that FHIR resources follow specific structures (e.g., Patient, Observation, Medication), and you'll need to understand their properties and relationships. The FHIR standard provides detailed documentation on resource types and their attributes.

**Additional Resources**:
- If you prefer a hands-on example, you can explore the **FHIR App React** sandbox on CodeSandbox³. It demonstrates creating goals and observations related to daily steps.
- For a quick video tutorial, watch the **Build a FHIR app with React in less than 10 minutes** video by bonFHIR⁴."
